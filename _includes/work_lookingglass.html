<p>Designed and patented (pending) a mechanism for self forming
  clusters running arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Designed and oversaw the transition from ArchLinux to RHEL.</p>

<p>Designed and implemented a release pipeline using Jenkins and
  dockers containers that builds the full product, installs it, tests
  it, makes it available in &lt;2 hours.</p>

<p>Designed and implemented a full automated system test suite to test
  our next gen analytical platform using Selenium and custom Clojure.
  Provisions a cluster (erases data, install test OS) loads test data,
  and runs behavioral and back-end tests.</p>

<p>Designed and implemented all QA processes including a 3 Tier
  technical support process taking the average time to resolution
  from weeks to less then a day.</p>

<p>Taught basic and advanced Git and Github usage, basic
  BDD/TDD behaviors and advanced testing techniques, GoLang
  primer, and Ansible primer.</p>

<p>Designed and implemented an automated system test suite to test
  previous gen product using ruby, selenium, and highly modified RSpec.
  Suite would check the software basic behaviors, data is within
  tolerance, and email nightly report to dev.</p>

<p>Implemented a reporting back-end which took network telemetry data
  and compared it against global threat intel data.  Through custom
  SQL and Postgres tricks brought a 10+ minute queries down to
  &lt;30s without any loss in fidelity.</p>

<p>Created a GoLang CLI command suite to translate Nfcapd files into
  bidirectional network telemetry format that could be ingested and
  compared against global threat intel data.  Worked around a flaw in
  GoLang 1.2 x-compile behavior by spinning up vagrant VMs for the
  target OS, performing a native compile, and bundling the compiled
  executable together.</p>
