<p>Converted obsolete Java web interface into a Rich Internet
  Application using ExtJS and Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Created a Live Interface Viewer that showed a real-time line chart
  of a single interface selected by the user.</p>

<p>Converted many common UI elements into defined Ext components:
  Wizard panel showing any number of forms (one at a time) with Next and
  Previous buttons, a Cron scheduling panel with a look similar to that
  of MS Outlook Event adder, a ComboTree that is like a ComboBox but the
  drop-down list is a floating tree instead of a mere menu of
  options.</p>

<p>Added Rspec to allow for Test Driven Design by enabling Quality
  Assurance and Product Management to define requirements that are
  directly tested to.  Set up a CruiseControl.rb server to allow the
  automatic integration testing of the RIA.</p>

<p>Re-factored the data-consolidation engine to enable true-to-life
  scalability testing and to enable consolidating multiple NetMRIs into
  a single topology model, allowing a single NetMRI to manage as many as
  50 subordinate NetMRIs.</p>

<p>Designed and implemented business intelligence reports (BIRT
  plug-in for Eclipse) for ISO 27002 and PCI compliance.</p>

<p>Integrated Riverbed device support into the product. Required
  finding Riverbed MIB and decoding them into NetMRI-usable information
  including: system, interface, and environmental data.  Required
  logging in via SSH or telnet and mapping running and startup config
  via Expect; then post process configs to remove control characters and
  paging artifacts.</p>
