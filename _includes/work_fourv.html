<p>Designed and helped migrate the existing FourV Greyspark product from custom built AMIs to docker containers running on Kubernetes capible of running in AWS, Azure, GCE, or on-prem OpenStack and VMWare vSphere servers.  IaC priniples used so both the patform and product deployers are docker images that drive deployment state from YAML configuration files.</p>

<p>Developed self-monitoring ElasticSearch cluster to support Greypsark's event exploration feature.  Cluster is fully multi-tenant using OpenID Connect JWT tokens to provide data isolation.  Uses best practices to ensure it can dynamically expand to pedibytes of storage.  ES nodes have custom developed watch-dogs which looks for known instabilities and performs the corrective.</p>
