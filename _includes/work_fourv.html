<p>Designed and helped migrate the existing FourV Greyspark product from custom built AMIs to docker containers running on Kubernetes capible of running in AWS, Azure, GCE, or on-prem OpenStack and VMWare vSphere servers.  IaC priniples used so both the patform and product deployers are docker images that drive deployment state from YAML configuration files.</p>

<p>Developed self-monitoring ElasticSearch cluster to support Greypsark's event exploration feature.  Cluster is fully multi-tenant using OpenID Connect JWT tokens to provide data isolation.  Uses best practices to ensure it can dynamically expand to pedibytes of storage.  ES nodes have custom developed watch-dogs which looks for known instabilities and performs the corrective.</p>

<p>Designed and built next-gen Kubernetes monitoring solution based on Prometheus and Grafana, which monitors all next-gen products and Cloud infrastructure in actionable Dashboards and Alerts.  Implementation based on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/199PqyG3UsyXlwieHaqbGiWVa8eMWi8zzAn0YfcApr8Q/edit#heading=h.fs3knmjt7fjy">Google's SRE monitoring philosophy</a> of customer important actionable alerts.
