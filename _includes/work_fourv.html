<p>Designed a multi-tenant archetecture for FourV's Greyspark product; saving the company $196K / month over the original single-tenant archetecture.  First layer of tenancy is a share-nothing layer similar to single-tenacy; allowing stricter guarantees at greater cost.  Second layer is a share-resources layer similar to traditional multi-tenancy.  Alowed us to cost target customers based on their expected needs.</p>

<p>Designed and helped migrate the existing FourV Greyspark product from custom built AMIs to docker containers running on Kubernetes.  Designed and implmented Kubernetes deployers for AWS, and VMWware vSphere.  Used IaC priniples so both the patform and product drive deployment state from YAML configuration files checked into Git.</p>

<p>Developed self-monitoring ElasticSearch cluster to support Greypsark's event exploration feature.  ES is fully multi-tenant using OpenID Connect JWT tokens to provide data isolation.  Uses best practices to ensure it can dynamically expand to pedibytes of storage.  ES nodes have custom developed watch-dogs which looks for known instabilities and performs corrective actions automatically.</p>

All deployments auto-update each night to lastest stable release.</p>

<p>Designed and implmeneted a company-wide monitoring solution using Sensu.  Montiors all production deployments, as well as critical internal and external infrastructure.</p>

<p>Designed and implmeneted Continuous Integration pipelines for all repos and products; including dev release to QA and QA's final release to customers.  Integrated code coverage into a Pull Request review process to ensure code quality.</p>

<p>Designed release versioning and branching solution that works across all 20+ FourV repos.  Version based on symantic versioning with optional hotpatch indicator and release cadidate indicator.  The branching soltuion similar to GitFlow; takes into account versioning across multiple respitories even when used across multiple products.</p>
