      <p>Designed and built a dashboard to manage a data-gathering product for the intelligence community.  The product uses Rails to provide a web interface to system services Riak and Apache, and configuration of the data-gathering software.</p>
      
      <p>Instituted Agile TDD/BDD development methodology.  Reduced sprints from four to two weeks, enabling more focused execution and planning.  Ensured completion of all committed-to work.  Led the customer demos after each sprint.</p>
      
      <p>Set up and maintained a Continuous Integration server to ensure a stable production branch.  Created an IRC channel for the team and configured Github and the CI server to announce changes to the channel.  Added Rspec for unit testing, Cucumber for integration testing, and Capybara/Selenium for in-browser javascript testing.</p>
      
      <p>Provided team training on various development topics including proper TDD, refactoring, standard Git usage, and advanced techniques including the Git-SVN bridge, basic and advanced Javascript techniques, and how Coffeescript eliminates common beginner mistakes in Javascript.</p>
      
      <p>Instituted a peer code-review process supported by Github.  This improved code readability, and quality.  It became a means of unintrusive knowledge sharing.  Personally paired with each team member to fill knowledge gaps and increase coding confidence.</p>

      Converted obsolete Java web interface into a Rich Internet Application using ExtJS and Ruby on Rails.<br><br>

      Created a Live Interface Viewer that showed a real-time line chart of a single interface selected by the user.<br><br>

      Converted many common UI elements into defined Ext components: Wizard panel showing any number of forms (one at a time) with Next and Previous buttons, a Cron scheduling panel with a look similar to that of MS Outlook Event adder, a ComboTree that is like a ComboBox but the drop-down list is a floating tree instead of a mere menu of options.<br><br>

      Added Rspec to allow for Test Driven Design by enabling Quality Assurance and Product Management to define requirements that are directly tested to.  Set up a CruiseControl.rb server to allow the automatic integration testing of the RIA.<br><br>

      Re-factored the data-consolidation engine to enable true-to-life scalability testing and to enable consolidating multiple NetMRIs into a single topology model, allowing a single NetMRI to manage as many as 50 subordinate NetMRIs.<br><br>

      Designed and implemented business intelligence reports (BIRT plug-in for Eclipse) for ISO 27002 and PCI compliance.<br><br>

      Integrated Riverbed device support into the product. Required finding Riverbed MIB and decoding them into NetMRI-usable information including: system, interface, and environmental data.  Required logging in via SSH or telnet and mapping running and startup config via Expect; then post process configs to remove control characters and paging artifacts.<br><br>

      Productized two IP DSLAM devices with Product Line Management.  Defined and reviewed the feature-set requirements of embedded Linux OS for devices.  Defined product software testing requirements before the Alpha release of the OS, including internal verification and external validation.  Validated technical advice to ensure timely product release.  Defined manufacturing test procedures and guided the product prototype.  Wrote technical, but jargon free, user manual input.  Provided support for all stages of the product live cycle.
      <br><br>
      Designed and co-implemented the management plane for Linux using CORBA (originally written after-hours as an open-source project).  Designed a web-based UI in Python using CGI/FCGI, HMTL templates, CSS for layout and formatting, and degradable Javascript.  Trained engineering staff in Python/CORBA (omniORB).  Designed embedded regression testing framework in Python.
      <br><br>
      <span class="heading">Software Engineer</span>, 2001-2005<br>
      Developed web-based UI on a VxWorks-based VOIP product line using the company's proprietary scripting language.  Developed an external Regression Testing framework for data communication products. Developed a 100% pure Java single-user NMS capable of simultaneously managing more than 200 network nodes.  This SQL database back-end NMS acquired status and configured devices via SNMP, FTP, and TFTP.  Developed the TFTP server for the pSOS kernel (System V variant). Developed stateful NAPT for the pSOS kernel as Posix MUX.
