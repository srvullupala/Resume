      <p>Designed and built a management dashboard to manage a data gathering product for the intelligence community.  The product utilized Rails to provide a web interface to system services like Riak, Apache as well configuration of the data gathering software.</p>
      
      <p>Instituted true Agile TDD/BDD development methodology.  Reduced sprints from 4 to 2 weeks, to enable more focused execution and planning.  Ensured completion of all committed-to work.  Lead post sprint customer demos.</p>
      
      <p>Setup and maintained Continuous Integration server to ensure stable production branch.  Created IRC channel for the team and configured Github and CI server to announce changes to the channel.  Added Rspec for unit testing, Cucumber for integration testing, and Capybara/Selenium for real browser testing.</p>
      
      <p>Provided team training on various development topics including proper TDD and refactoring, standard Git usage and advanced techniques like the Git-SVN bridge, basic and advanced Javascript techniques, how Coffeescript eliminates common beginner mistakes in Javascript.</p>
      
      <p>Instituted a peer code review process supported by Github.  This improved code readability, quality; became unintrusive knowledge sharing.  Personally paired with all team members to fill knowledge gaps and increase coding confidence</p>

      Converted older Java web interface into an Rich Internet Application using ExtJS and Ruby on Rails.<br><br>

      Created a Live Interface Viewer that shows a realtime line chart of on a single interface selected by the user.<br><br>

      Converted many common UI elements into defined Ext components: wizard panel showing any number of forms (one at a time) with next and previous buttons, a Cron scheduling panel with a similar look to that of MS Outlook Event adder, a ComboTree that is like a ComboBox but the drop-down list is a floating tree instead of a simple menu of options.<br><br>

      Added Rspec to allow for Test Driven Design by enabling Quality Assurance and Product Management to define requirements which are directly tested to.  Setup a CruiseControl.rb server to allow the automatic integration testing of the RIA.<br><br>

      Re-factored data consolidation engine to enable true to life scalability testing and to enable the consolidation on multiple NetMRIs into a single topology model.  Allowing a single NetMRI to manage up to 50 subordinate NetMRIs.<br><br>

      Designed and implemented business intelligence reports (BIRT plug-in for Eclipse) for ISO 27002 and PCI compliance.<br><br>

      Integrated Riverbed device support into the product. Required finding Riverbed MIB and decoding them into NetMRI usable information including: system, interface, and environmental data.  Required logging in via SSH or telnet and mapping running and startup config via Expect; then post process configs to remove control characters and paging artifacts.<br><br>
